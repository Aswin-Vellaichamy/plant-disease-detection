# MULTIPLE PLANT LEAF DISEASE DETECTION USING DENSENET-121 ARCHITECTURE
The motive of this project is to identify diseases in plants and crops and advice on farmers to use 

# Dataset 

We used 35779 images out of 54,305 that were available in PlantVillage Dataset. This is downloadable from kaggle

# Quick details of the project

In this project, the original image is converted to HSV color
form and then the masked image is generated by thresholding and given to the proposed model for training and classification, giving an average accuracy Multiple Plant Leaf Disease Classification using Densenet-121 Architecture (theoretical) of 98.23%. When all classes of plant disease are given together to the model for training on google colab platform, (Tesla-T4 processor) we got an average
accuracy of 94.96% for 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.002. Additionally, a basic user-friendly website to test the trained model for the disease affected plant images and get prescription for the plant disease. Further the scope to extend the dataset used
for training to identify many plant diseases.
